# Deployment Setup

This repo is wired so that a push to `main` automatically builds the Lambda/dashboard
Docker images that changed, pushes them to ECR, runs `terraform apply`, and — for the
dashboard — lets ArgoCD roll the new image out to EKS. Each of the 3 Lambdas and the
dashboard has its own independent workflow (`deploy-ingest.yml`, `deploy-transform.yml`,
`deploy-dq.yml`, `deploy-dashboard.yml`) that only runs when that component's own files
change; `deploy.yml` handles everything else (S3, IAM, Glue, Step Functions, EventBridge,
SNS, Athena, EKS, ArgoCD itself). None of that can run until the steps below are done
once, manually, by someone with real AWS and GitHub admin access. This is a
chicken-and-egg problem: the roles GitHub Actions needs to authenticate to AWS don't
exist until you create them, and CI can't create its own trust relationship.

## 1. Apply the bootstrap stack (once)

```
cd terraform/bootstrap
terraform init
terraform apply
```

This creates:
- The Terraform remote state backend (S3 bucket + DynamoDB lock table) that
  `terraform/envs/prod/backend.tf` depends on.
- A GitHub OIDC provider, plus two IAM roles GitHub Actions assumes via short-lived
  tokens (no long-lived AWS keys stored in the repo):
  - `gha-plan-role` — read-only, usable from pull request builds.
  - `gha-deploy-role` — full deploy permissions, usable only from pushes to `main`.

Note the two role ARNs from the output (`gha_plan_role_arn`, `gha_deploy_role_arn`) —
you'll need them in step 2.

Its state is kept separate from `envs/prod` on purpose (see the comment at the top of
`terraform/bootstrap/main.tf`) — it changes rarely and manages the account-level trust
relationship that everything else depends on.

## 2. Configure the GitHub repository

In **Settings → Secrets and variables → Actions**:

| Type | Name | Value |
|---|---|---|
| Variable | `AWS_REGION` | `us-east-1` |
| Variable | `AWS_PLAN_ROLE_ARN` | `gha_plan_role_arn` output from step 1 |
| Variable | `AWS_DEPLOY_ROLE_ARN` | `gha_deploy_role_arn` output from step 1 |
| Variable | `DASHBOARD_ALLOWED_CIDR` | Your office/VPN CIDR (e.g. `203.0.113.4/32`) — **never `0.0.0.0/0`**, the dashboard pod carries AWS read credentials via IRSA behind that NodePort |
| Secret | `YOUTUBE_API_KEY` | A freshly issued YouTube Data API v3 key |
| Secret | `DASHBOARD_TRIGGER_API_KEY` | A random shared secret you generate (e.g. `openssl rand -hex 32`) — required as the `X-API-Key` header to `POST /trigger` on the dashboard |

> If you're rotating off a previously exposed key (see the Security Notes below),
> generate a brand new one in Google Cloud Console rather than reusing the old value.

In **Settings → Environments**, create an environment named `production` and add at
least one required reviewer. `deploy.yml`'s `terraform-apply` job targets this
environment as a manual-approval gate — every infrastructure change gets a human
sign-off before it applies, even though the rest of the pipeline is automatic.

## 3. Bootstrap ArgoCD (once, after the first `terraform apply`)

`terraform apply` installs ArgoCD itself (`module.argocd`, the `argo-cd` Helm chart) but
not the `Application` resource that points it at this repo — that's applied once,
manually, since it's a CRD-backed resource and essentially static after creation:

```
kubectl apply -f k8s/argocd/application.yaml
```

Before letting ArgoCD auto-sync, confirm there's no drift between git and the live
cluster: `kubectl diff -f k8s/` should print nothing. Only then add a `syncPolicy.automated:
{prune: true, selfHeal: true}` block to `k8s/argocd/application.yaml` (omitted by
default on purpose) — enabling it before confirming zero drift risks ArgoCD reverting
the live Deployment/ServiceAccount to whatever's currently committed.

## 4. Push to `main`

With steps 1-3 done, a push to `main` runs whichever workflows match the changed paths:
- **`deploy.yml`** (any `terraform/**`, `glue_jobs/**` change) — lints the repo, then
  waits for the `production` environment approval and applies everything except the 3
  Lambdas and the dashboard: S3 buckets, IAM roles, Glue jobs/catalog, Step Functions,
  EventBridge schedule, SNS, Athena, Secrets Manager, the EKS cluster, and ArgoCD.
- **`deploy-ingest.yml` / `deploy-transform.yml` / `deploy-dq.yml`** (that Lambda's own
  source or Terraform module changes) — builds and pushes that Lambda's image, then
  applies just its own Terraform module (`-target`) against the same shared state.
- **`deploy-dashboard.yml`** (`dashboard/**` changes) — builds and pushes the image,
  bumps the tag in `k8s/deployment.yaml`, and commits that change back to `main`
  (`[skip ci]`, so it doesn't re-trigger anything). ArgoCD picks up the change and rolls
  it out — no `kubectl` in this workflow at all.

## The dashboard is a control panel, not just a viewer

The dashboard (NodePort 30080) shows recent Step Functions executions, the last
data-quality result, and Gold table stats — and can also:
- **Trigger a new pipeline run**: `POST /trigger` with header `X-API-Key: <DASHBOARD_TRIGGER_API_KEY>`.
  Returns `401` on a missing/wrong key, `409` if a run is already in progress (prevents
  overlapping executions), `200` + the new execution name/ARN otherwise. Each trigger
  costs real YouTube API quota and AWS compute, hence the API key requirement on top of
  the `DASHBOARD_ALLOWED_CIDR` network restriction.
- **Run predefined Gold-table queries**: `GET /query/top_channels`, `/query/top_categories`,
  `/query/trending_summary` — fixed queries only (no free-form SQL), to keep Athena scan
  cost bounded and avoid exposing a query-injection surface on a network port.

## Ongoing cost

Once applied, the EKS cluster (control plane + 2× `t3.small` nodes) runs continuously
at roughly **$100-120/month** until torn down — this is not a one-time cost. To tear
everything down: `terraform -chdir=terraform/envs/prod destroy` (the bootstrap stack's
state bucket and lock table have `prevent_destroy = true` and are meant to be kept).

## Known tradeoffs

- **EventBridge runs the pipeline hourly** (`rate(1 hour)`, in `terraform/modules/eventbridge`),
  a deliberate choice to keep the project properly event-driven. Each full run costs
  roughly 1,000 YouTube Data API quota units (10 regions); at 24 runs/day that's
  ~24,000 units against the default 10,000/day free quota. Expect `yt-ingest` to start
  failing with quota-exceeded errors partway through most days, and the resulting SNS
  failure alerts are expected noise, not a regression — not a bug to chase.

## Security notes

- The dashboard's NodePort (30080) is only reachable from `DASHBOARD_ALLOWED_CIDR` —
  set this to a real, narrow CIDR before the first apply, not `0.0.0.0/0`.
- `youtube_api_key` and the AWS role ARNs are never written to disk or `.tfvars` in
  this repo; they're passed as `-var` flags from GitHub Actions secrets/variables at
  apply time.
- If you ever find a real credential committed to this repo, treat it as compromised
  immediately (rotate it at the provider) even after removing it from git history —
  history rewrites don't undo prior exposure on a pushed remote.
